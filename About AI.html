     <h3><i>About Artificial Intelligence</i></h3> 
     <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled
        robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is 
        frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the 
        intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, 
        discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development 
        of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can 
        be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs 
        for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite 
        continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are 
        as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks 
        requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained 
        the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain 
        specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in 
        applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice 
        or handwriting recognition.
